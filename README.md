# ASA-Datafest
Datathon Hosted by the Department of Statistical Sciences in collaboration with Rotman TD Management Data and Analytics Lab where students are tasked with diving deep into data to extract meaningful insights and propose innovative solutions. This year’s competition centered around the CourseKata project, challenging participants to enhance the learning experience of statistics through interactive e-books. 

The repository contains the final products of the competition: video, slide deck, one-page summary (We were not allowed to upload the code files or datasets).
